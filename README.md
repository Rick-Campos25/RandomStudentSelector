This Python project selects one student at random from a list stored in an Excel file. It reads names from cells A2 to A19 in a file named 'hello.xlsx' and randomly chooses one to "answer the next question." It's a useful classroom tool for encouraging participation in an unbiased and engaging way.

Language Used:
Python

Libraries Used:
- openpyxl (for reading data from Excel files)
- random (for selecting a random student)

How It Works:
- The Excel file `hello.xlsx` must contain student names in cells A2 through A19.
- The program loads the Excel file, reads the specified range, and stores the names in a list.
- A random name is selected and displayed as the chosen student.

Note:
Make sure the Excel file `hello.xlsx` is located in the same directory as the Python script.
